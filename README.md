This project implements a simulation of jelly-like tetris pieces falling in a thin invisible container

This was done as my final project for the UWaterloo CS488 (graphics) course. It is rendered in a raytracer that I built over the course of the term.

**Note:** This is not the full program project as that contains course intellectual property. This contains just my code and thus cannot be run on its own
